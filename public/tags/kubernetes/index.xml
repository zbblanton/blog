      <description>Creating a Kubernetes Controller Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get deeper into Kubernetes whether I&amp;rsquo;m learning best practices or trying to develop tools on and for the platform. This lead me down the road to learning how to create a controller for Kubernetes. Turns out, this wasn&amp;rsquo;t a very smooth road.
The current implementation for the controller is located at https://github.com/zbblanton/cloudflare_dynamic_dns_controller.
The Goal I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to build a controller for Kubernetes that runs in the cluster but didn&amp;rsquo;t have any ideas until I thought of doing some simple dynamic DNS for Cloudflare.</description>

      <description>Setting Up Cloudflare Dynamic DNS On Kubernetes I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on switching all of my home infrastructure to Kubernetes including the blog you&amp;rsquo;re reading now. My ISP luckily doesn&amp;rsquo;t block port 80 and 443 so I can simply let Cloudflare point to my public IP. The problem is my IP is dynamic and can change at any point. So I needed something that can watch for my IP to change and then update Cloudflare with the new address.</description>

      <description>Building a Web Server on OpenFaaS Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with OpenFaaS on Kubernetes and I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a small project to run on it. I&amp;rsquo;ve also wanted to start this static blog and figured this is a perfect project to run on OpenFaaS.
Prerequisites Before we start make sure you have installed OpenFaaS on Kubernetes. This can be done in a few commands if you already have Helm installed.</description>
